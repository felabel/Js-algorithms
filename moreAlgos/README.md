Cartesian Product - Givenn two finite non-empty sets, find their cartesian product
- In mathematics, a cartesian product is the an array that contains the elements in 2 sets dnoted by A*B
- Example;
- set A = [1,2] and set B = [3,4]
A*B = [[1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2,4]]

Solution idea
- Traverse each array and pair each element in the first array with each element in the second
